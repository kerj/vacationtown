          A week of festivities starts with the Kosui Festival. Legend holds
          that at the bottom of Lake Ashi in Hakone a nine headed dragon lived,
          tormenting local villagers. He was placated and calmed by a
          wandering priest and now protects the shores of the lake and the
          people and visitors to the Hakone area. The festivities are
          centered around an offering of sake and red rice to the dragon by
          the priests of Hakone Shrine.

          This is one of Hakone`s largest festivals. Walk among the food stalls
           along the cool shores of Lake Ashi and enjoy the firework display in
            the evening. The serene setting of floating lanterns, toro-nagashi,
            and illuminated red shrine gates is a wonderful scene to experience.
